# GENI-THE-GENERATOR
This Python Dice Game simulates rolling dice for one or more players. It uses random number generation to produce dice outcomes, tracks player scores, and determines the winner. With a simple menu-driven interface and clear feedback, it demonstrates loops, conditionals, and Python’s random module.
